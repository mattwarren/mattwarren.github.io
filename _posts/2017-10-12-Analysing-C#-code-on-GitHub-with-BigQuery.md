title: Analysing C# code on GitHub with BigQuery
comments: true
tags: [C#]
---

Just over a year ago Google made all the [open source code on GitHub available for querying](https://medium.com/google-cloud/github-on-bigquery-analyze-all-the-code-b3576fd2b150) within BigQuery and as if that wasn't enough [you can run a terabyte of queries each month for free](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/01/how-to-run-a-terabyte-of-google-bigquery-queries-each-month-without-a-credit-card)!

So in this post I am going to be looking at all the **C#** source code on GitHub and what we can find out from it. Handily a smaller, C# only, dataset has been made available (in BigQuery you are charged per byte read), called [fh-bigquery:github_extracts.contents_net_cs](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/fh-bigquery:github_extracts.contents_net_cs) and has

- **5,885,933** unique '.cs' files
- **792,166,632** lines of code (LOC)
- **37.17 GB** (37,174,783,891 bytes) of data

Which is a pretty comprehensive set of C# source code!

The rest of this post will *attempt* to answer the following questions:

1. [Tabs or Spaces?](#tabs-or-spaces)
1. [`regions`: 'should be banned' or 'okay in some cases'?](#regions-should-be-banned-or-okay-in-some-cases)
1. ['K&R' or 'Allman', where do C# devs like to put their braces?](#kr-or-allman-where-do-c-devs-like-to-put-their-braces)
1. [Do C# developers like writing functional code?](#do-c-developers-like-writing-functional-code)

Then moving onto some less controversial C# topics:
 
1. [Which `using` statements are most widely used?](#which-using-statements-are-most-widely-used)
1. [What NuGet packages are most often included in a .NET project](#what-nuget-packages-are-most-often-included-in-a-net-project)
1. [How many lines of code (LOC) are in a typical C# file?](#how-many-lines-of-code-loc-are-in-a-typical-c-file)
1. [What is the most widely thrown `Exception`?](#what-is-the-most-widely-thrown-exception)
1. ['async/await all the things' or not?](#asyncawait-all-the-things-or-not)
1. [Do C# developers like using the `var` keyword?](#do-c-developers-like-using-the-var-keyword)

Before we end up looking at repositories, not just individual C# files:

1. [What is the most popular repository with C# code in it?](#what-is-the-most-popular-repository-with-c-code-in-it)
1. [Just how many files should you have in a repository?](#just-how-many-files-should-you-have-in-a-repository)
1. [What are the most popular C# `class` names?](#what-are-the-most-popular-c-class-names)
1. ['Foo.cs', 'Program.cs' or something else, what's the most common file name?](#foocs-programcs-or-something-else-whats-the-most-common-file-name)

If you want to try the queries for yourself (or find my mistakes), all of them are available in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mattwarren/42100ffe488bce5d48be22b59124b752). There's a good chance that my regular expressions miss out some edge-cases, after all [Regular Expressions: Now You Have Two Problems](https://blog.codinghorror.com/regular-expressions-now-you-have-two-problems/):

> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems.

### Tabs or Spaces?

In the entire data-set there are 5,885,933 files, but here we only include ones that have more than 10 lines starting with a tab or a space

| Tabs | Tabs % | Spaces | Spaces % | Total |
|:----:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|:-----:| 
| 799,055 | 17.15% | 3,859,528 | 82.85% | 4,658,583 |

Clearly, C# developers (on GitHub) prefer **Spaces** over **Tabs**, let the endless debates continue!! (I think *some* of this can be explained by the fact that Visual Studio [uses 'spaces' by default](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/zainnab/2010/09/08/insert-spaces-vs-keep-tabs/))

If you want to see how C# compares to other programming languages, take a look at [400,000 GitHub repositories, 1 billion files, 14 terabytes of code: Spaces or Tabs?](https://medium.com/@hoffa/400-000-github-repositories-1-billion-files-14-terabytes-of-code-spaces-or-tabs-7cfe0b5dd7fd).

### `regions`: 'should be banned' or 'okay in some cases'?

It turns out that there are an impressive **712,498** C# files (out of 5.8 million) that contain at least one `#region` statement ([query used](https://gist.github.com/mattwarren/42100ffe488bce5d48be22b59124b752#regions)), that's just over 12%. (I'm hoping that a lot of those files have been auto-generated by a tool!)

### 'K&R' or 'Allman', where do C# devs like to put their braces?

C# developers overwhelmingly prefer putting an opening brace `{` on it's own line ([query used](https://gist.github.com/mattwarren/42100ffe488bce5d48be22b59124b752#brace_placement))

| separate line | same line | same line (initializer) | |  total (with brace)  | total (all code) |
|:-------------:|:---------:|-------------------------|-|----------------------|------------------| 
| 81,306,320 (67%) | 40,044,603 (33%) | 3,631,947 (2.99%) | | 121,350,923 (15.32%) | 792,166,632 |

('same line initializers' include code like `new { Name = "", .. }`, `new [] { 1, 2, 3.. }`) 

### Do C# developers like writing functional code?

This is slightly unscientific, but I wanted to see how widely the [Lambda Operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-operator) `=>` is used in C# code ([query](https://gist.github.com/mattwarren/42100ffe488bce5d48be22b59124b752#lambdas)). Yes, I know, if you want to write functional code on .NET you really should use F#, but C# has become more 'functional' over the years and I wanted to see how much code was taking advantage of that.

Here's the raw percentiles:

| Percentile | % of lines using lambdas |
|:----------:|:---------------:|
| 10 |  0.51 |
| 25 |  1.14 |
| 50 |  2.50 |
| 75 |  5.26 |
| 90 |  9.95 |
| 95 | 14.29 |
| 99 | 28.00 |

So we can say that:

- 50% of all the C# code on GitHub uses `=>` on 2.44% (or less) of their lines.
- 10% of all C# files have lambdas on almost 1 in 10 of their lines
- 5% use `=>` on 1 in 7 lines (14.29%)
- 1% of files have lambdas on over 1 in 3 lines (28%) of their lines of code, that's pretty impressive!

### Which `using` statements are most widely used?

Now on to some a bit more substantial, what are the most widely used `using` statements in C# code?

The top 10 looks like this (the [full results are available](https://gist.github.com/mattwarren/be5df65729b0188d31463e3f143ba886)):

| using statement                        |  count    |
|----------------------------------------|----------:| 
| using System.Collections.Generic;      | 1,780,646 | 
| using System;                          | 1,477,019 | 
| using System.Linq;                     | 1,319,830 | 
| using System.Text;                     | 902,165   | 
| using System.Threading.Tasks;          | 628,195   | 
| using System.Runtime.InteropServices;  | 431,867   | 
| using System.IO;                       | 407,848   | 
| using System.Runtime.CompilerServices; | 338,686   | 
| using System.Collections;              | 289,867   | 
| using System.Reflection;               | 218,369   | 

However, [as was pointed out](https://twitter.com/davkean/status/917523113587257344), the top 5 are included by default when you add a new file in Visual Studio and many people wouldn't remove them. The same applies to 'System.Runtime.InteropServices' and 'System.Runtime.CompilerServices' which are include in 'AssemblyInfo.cs` by default.

So if we adjust the list to take account of this, the top 10 looks like so:
  
| using statement                        |  count    | 
|----------------------------------------|----------:| 
| using System.IO;                       | 407,848   | 
| using System.Collections;              | 289,867   | 
| using System.Reflection;               | 218,369   | 
| using System.Diagnostics;              | 201,341   | 
| using System.Threading;                | 179,168   | 
| using System.ComponentModel;           | 160,681   | 
| using System.Web;                      | 160,323   | 
| using System.Windows.Forms;            | 137,003   | 
| using System.Globalization;            | 132,113   | 
| using System.Drawing;                  | 127,033   |

Finally, an interesting list is the top 10 using statements that aren't `System`, `Microsoft` or `Windows` namespaces:

| using statement             |  count  |
|-----------------------------|--------:|  
| using NUnit.Framework;      | 119,463 | 
| using UnityEngine;          | 117,673 | 
| using Xunit;                | 99,099  | 
| using Newtonsoft.Json;      | 81,675  | 
| using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq; | 29,416  | 
| using Moq;                  | 23,546  | 
| using UnityEngine.UI;       | 20,355  | 
| using UnityEditor;          | 19,937  | 
| using Amazon.Runtime;       | 18,941  | 
| using log4net;              | 17,297  |


### What NuGet packages are most often included in a .NET project?

It turns out that there is also a separate dataset containing all the 'packages.config' files on GitHub, it's called [contents_net_packages_config](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/fh-bigquery:github_extracts.contents_net_packages_config) and has 104,808 entries. By querying this we can see that [Json.Net](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) is the clear winner!!

| package                           |  count  | 
|-----------------------------------|--------:| 
| Newtonsoft.Json                   | 45,055  | 
| Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure      | 16,022  | 
| Microsoft.AspNet.Razor            | 15,109  | 
| Microsoft.AspNet.WebPages         | 14,495  | 
| Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc              | 14,236  | 
| EntityFramework                   | 14,191  | 
| Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client    | 13,480  | 
| Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core      | 12,210  | 
| Microsoft.Net.Http                | 11,625  | 
| jQuery                            | 10,646  | 
| Microsoft.Bcl.Build               | 10,641  | 
| Microsoft.Bcl                     | 10,349  | 
| NUnit                             | 10,341  | 
| Owin                              | 9,681   | 
| Microsoft.Owin                    | 9,202   | 
| Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.WebHost   | 9,007   | 
| WebGrease                         | 8,743   | 
| Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization | 8,721   | 
| Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi           | 8,179   | 

### How many lines of code (LOC) are in a typical C# file?

Are C# developers prone to creating huge files that go one for 1000's of lines? Well some are but fortunately it's the minority of us!!

[![Percentiles of lines of code per file]({{ base }}/images/2017/10/Percentiles%20of%20lines%20of%20code%20per%20file.png)]({{ base }}/images/2017/10/Percentiles%20of%20lines%20of%20code%20per%20file.png)

Note the Y-axis is 'lines of code' and is logarithmic, the [raw data is available](https://gist.github.com/mattwarren/c810abe0c1ea152b60632c5987161aa4).

Oh dear, Uncle Bob isn't going to be happy, whilst 96% of the files have 509 LOC of less, the other 4% don't!! From [Clean Code](http://amzn.to/2yezlZH):

[![Uncle Bob - Clean Code - Number of lines of code in a file]({{ base }}/images/2017/10/Uncle Bob - Clean Code - Number of lines of code in a file.png)]({{ base }}/images/2017/10/Uncle Bob - Clean Code - Number of lines of code in a file.png)

And in case you're wondering, here's the Top 10 longest C# files!!

| File                                                                               | Lines  |  
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------:|

### What is the most widely thrown `Exception`?

There's a few interesting results in [this query](https://gist.github.com/mattwarren/42100ffe488bce5d48be22b59124b752#most-popular-execeptions), for instance who knew that so many `ApplicationExceptions` were thrown and `NotSupportedException` being so high up the list is a bit worrying!!

| Exception                             |  count    |  
|---------------------------------------|----------:| 
| throw new ArgumentNullException       |  699,526  | 
| throw new ArgumentException           |  361,616  | 
| throw new NotImplementedException     |  340,361  | 
| throw new InvalidOperationException   |  260,792  | 
| throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException |  160,640  | 
| throw new NotSupportedException       |  110,019  | 
| throw new HttpResponseException       |  74,498   | 
| throw new ValidationException         |  35,615   | 
| throw new ObjectDisposedException     |  31,129   | 
| throw new ApplicationException        |  30,849   | 
| throw new UnauthorizedException       |  21,133   | 
| throw new FormatException             |  19,510   | 
| throw new SerializationException      |  17,884   | 
| throw new IOException                 |  15,779   | 
| throw new IndexOutOfRangeException    |  14,778   | 
| throw new NullReferenceException      |  12,372   | 
| throw new InvalidDataException        |  12,260   | 
| throw new ApiException                |  11,660   | 
| throw new InvalidCastException        |  10,510   | 

### 'async/await all the things' or not?

The addition of the `async` and `await` keywords to the C# language makes writing [asynchronous code much easier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/async):

``` csharp
public async Task<int> GetDotNetCountAsync()
{
    // Suspends GetDotNetCountAsync() to allow the caller (the web server)
    // to accept another request, rather than blocking on this one.
    var html = await _httpClient.DownloadStringAsync("http://dotnetfoundation.org");

    return Regex.Matches(html, ".NET").Count;
}
``` 

But how much is it used? Using the query below:

``` SQL
SELECT Count(*) count
FROM
  [fh-bigquery:github_extracts.contents_net_cs]
WHERE
  REGEXP_MATCH(content, r'\sasync\s|\sawait\s')
```

I found that there are **218,643** files (out of 5,885,933) that have at least one usage of `async` or `await` in them.

### Do C# developers like using the `var` keyword?

Less that they use `async` and `await`, there are **130,590** files that have at least one usage of the `var` keyword 

----

### Just how many files should you have in a repository?

90%	of the repositories (that have any C# files) have 95 files or less. 95% have 170 files or less and 99% have	535 files or less.

[![Number of C# Files per Repository]({{ base }}/images/2017/10/Number of Files per Repository.png)]({{ base }}/images/2017/10/Number of Files per Repository.png)

(again the Y-axis (# files) is logarithmic)

The top 10 largest repositories, by number of C# files are shown below:

| Repository                                         | # Files      |

### What is the most popular repository with C# code in it?

This time we are going to look at the most popular repositories (based on GitHub 'stars') that contain at least 50 C# files ([query used](https://gist.github.com/mattwarren/42100ffe488bce5d48be22b59124b752#most_popular_c_repos)):

Interesting that the top spot is a Google Repository! (the C# files in it are sample code for using the GRPC library from .NET) 

### What are the most popular C# `class` names?

Assuming that I got the [regex correct](https://gist.github.com/mattwarren/42100ffe488bce5d48be22b59124b752#class_names), the most popular C# `class` names are the following:

| Class name      | Count  | 
|-----------------|-------:| 
| class C         | 182480 | 
| class Program   | 163462 | 
| class Test      | 50593  | 
| class Settings  | 40841  | 
| class Resources | 39345  | 
| class A         | 34687  | 
| class App       | 28462  | 
| class B         | 24246  | 
| class Startup   | 18238  | 
| class Foo       | 15198  |

Yay for `Foo`, just sneaking into the Top 10!! 

### 'Foo.cs', 'Program.cs' or something else, what's the most common file name?

Finally lets look at the different `class` names used, as with the `using` statement they are dominated by the default ones used in the Visual Studio templates:

| File                  | Count  | 
|-----------------------|-------:| 
| AssemblyInfo.cs       | 386822 | 
| Program.cs            | 105280 | 
| Resources.Designer.cs | 40881  | 
| Settings.Designer.cs  | 35392  | 
| App.xaml.cs           | 21928  | 
| Global.asax.cs        | 16133  | 
| Startup.cs            | 14564  | 
| HomeController.cs     | 13574  | 
| RouteConfig.cs        | 11278  | 
| MainWindow.xaml.cs    | 11169  |
