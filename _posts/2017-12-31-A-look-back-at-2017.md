I've now been blogging consistently for over 2 years (~2 times per/month) and I decided it was time for my first 'retrospective' post. 

<strong style="color:red">Warning</strong> this post contains a large amount of [**humble brags**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=humblebrag), if you've come here to read about ['*.NET internals*']({{ base }}/tags/#Internals) you'd better check back in a few weeks, when normal service will be resumed!

## Overall Stats

Firstly, lets looks at my Google Analytics stats for 2017, showing **Page Views** and **Sessions**:

[![Blog - Page Views & Sessions - 2017]({{ base }}/images/2017/12/Blog - Page Views & Sessions - 2017.png)]({{ base }}/images/2017/12/Blog - Page Views & Sessions - 2017.png)

Which clearly shows that I took a bit of a break during the summer! But I still managed over 800K page views, mostly because I was fortunate enough to end up on the [front page of HackerNews a few times](https://hn.algolia.com/?query=mattwarren.org%2F2017&sort=byPopularity&prefix&page=0&dateRange=pastYear&type=story)!

As a comparison, here's what '2017 v 2016' looks like:

[![Blog - Page Views - 2016 v 2017]({{ base }}/images/2017/12/Blog - Page Views - 2016 v 2017.png)]({{ base }}/images/2017/12/Blog - Page Views - 2016 v 2017.png)

This is cool because it shows a nice trend, more people read my blog posts in 2017 than in 2016 (but I have no idea if it will continue in 2018?!)

Next, here are my **top 10 most read** posts. Surprising enough my most read post was literally just a list with 68 entries in it!!

## Traffic Sources

I was going to do a write-up on where/how I get my blog traffic, but instead I'd encourage you to read [6 Years of Thoughts on Programming](https://henrikwarne.com/2017/11/26/6-years-of-thoughts-on-programming) by [Henrik Warne](https://twitter.com/henrikwarne) as his experience **exactly** matches mine. But in summary, getting onto the front-page of [HackerNews](http://news.ycombinator.com/) drives **a lot** of traffic to your site/blog.

**Finally, a big thanks to everyone who has read, commented on or shared my blogs posts, it means a lot!!**
