This is the part 3 of a mini-series looking at what it *might* take to build the Stack Overflow Tag Engine, if you haven't read [part 1]({{base}}/2014/11/01/the-stack-overflow-tag-engine-part-1/) or [part 2]({{base}}/2015/08/19/the-stack-overflow-tag-engine-part-2/), I recommend reading them first.

---------------------------------------

## <a name="ComplexBooleanQueries"></a>**Complex boolean queries**

One of the most powerful features of the Stack Overflow Tag Engine is that it allows you to do complex boolean queries against multiple Tag, for instance:

- [.net OR (NOT jquery)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/.net+or+jquery-)
- [.net OR (NOT jquery) AND javascript](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/.net+or+jquery-+javascript)

A simple way of implementing this is to write code like below, which makes use of a [`HashSet`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb359438(v=vs.110).aspx) to let us efficiently do lookups to see if a particular questions should be included or excluded. 

``` csharp
var result = new List<Question>(pageSize);
var andHashSet = new HastSet<int>(queryInfo[tag2]);
foreach (var id in queryInfo[tag1])
{
    if (result.Count >= pageSize)
        break;

    baseQueryCounter++;
    if (questions[id].Tags.Any(t => tagsToExclude.Contains(t))) 
    {
        excludedCounter++;
    }
    else if (andHashSet.Remove(item))
    {
        if (itemsSkipped >= skip)
            result.Add(questions[item]);
        else
            itemsSkipped++;
    }
}
```

The main problem is that we have to scan through all the ids for `tag1` until we have enough matches, i.e. `foreach (var id in queryInfo[tag1])`. In addition we have to initially load up the `HashSet` with all the ids for `tag2`, so that we can check matches. So this method takes longer as we skip more and more questions, i.e. for larger value of `skip` or if there are a large amount of `tagsToExclude` (i.e. "*Ignored Tags*"), see [Part 2 for more infomation]({{base}}/2015/08/19/the-stack-overflow-tag-engine-part-2/#IgnoredTags).

## <a name="Bitmaps"></a>**Bitmaps**

So can we do any better, well yes, there is a fairly established mechanism for doing these types of queries, known as [**Bitmap indexes**](http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2008/08/20/the-mythical-bitmap-index/). To use these you have to pre-calculate an index in which each bit is set to `1` to indicate a match and `0` otherwise. In our scenario this looks so: 

[![Bit Map Indexing explanation]({{ base }}/images/2015/10/bit-map-indexing-explanation.png)]({{ base }}/images/2015/10/bit-map-indexing-explanation.png)

Then it is just a case of doing the relevant bitwise operations against the bits (a `byte` at a time), for example if you want to get the questions that have the `C#` `AND` `Java` Tags, you do the following:

``` csharp
for (int i = 0; i < numBits / 8; i++)
{
    result[i] = bitSetCSharp[i] & bitSetJava[i];
}
```

The main drawback is that we have to create a Bitmap index for *each* tag (`C#`, `.NET`, `Java`, etc) for *every* sort order (`LastActivityDate`, `CreationDate`, `Score`, `ViewCount`, `AnswerCount`), so we soon use up a *lot* of memory. The Sept 2014 Stack Overflow dataset contains just under 8 million questions and so at 8 questions per byte, a single Bitmap needs 976KB or 0.95MB. This adds up to an impressive **149GB** (0.95MB * 32,000 Tags * 5 sort orders).

## <a name="CompressedBitmaps"></a>**Compressed Bitmaps**

Fortunately there is a way to heavily compress the Bitmaps using a form of [Run-length encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding), to do this I made use of the [C# version](https://github.com/lemire/csharpewah) of the excellent [EWAH library](https://github.com/lemire/javaewah). This library is based on the research carried out in the paper [Sorting improves word-aligned bitmap indexes](http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3751) by [Daniel Lemire](https://twitter.com/lemire) and others. By using EWAH it has the added benefit that you don't need to uncompress the Bitmap to perform the bitwise operations, they can be done in-place (for an idea of how this is done take a look at [this commit where I added a single in-place `AndNot` function](https://github.com/mattwarren/StackOverflowTagServer/commit/20561e60e1b7d90ff0bb023ec8cf89494d0705f5) to the existing library). 

However if you don't want to read the [research paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3751), the diagram below shows how the Bitmap is compressed into 64-bit `words` that have 1 or more bits set, plus runs of repeating zeros or ones. So `31 0x00` indicates that 31 instances of a `64-bit word` (with all the bits set to `0`) have be encoded as a single value, rather than as 31 individual `words`.

```
0 0x00
1 words
        [   0]=                   17,  2 bits set ->
        {0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010001}

        [   0]=                   64,  1 bits set ->

        [   1]=     9007199254740992,  1 bits set ->
        {0000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000}
        [   2]=     9007199304740992,  13 bits set ->
        {0000000000100000000000000000000000000010111110101111000010000000}
131 0x00

        [   0]=            536870912,  1 bits set ->
        {0000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000}
....
```

To give an idea of the space savings that can be achieved, the table below shows the size in bytes for compressed Bitmaps that have varying amounts of individual bit set to `1` (for comparision uncompressed Bitmaps are 1,000,000 bytes or 0.95MB)

| # Bits Set | Size in Bytes |
|------------|---------------|
| 1 | 24 |
| 10 | 168 |
| 25 | 408 |
| 50 | 808 |
| 100 | 1,608 |
| 200 | 3,208 |
| 400 | 6,408 |
| 800 | 12,808 |
| 1,600 | 25,608 |
| 32,000 | 512,008 |
| 64,000 | 1,000,008 |
| 128,000 | 1,000,008 |

As you can see it's not until we get over 64,000 bits (62,016 to be precise) that we match the size of the regular Bitmaps. **Note:** in these tests I was setting the bits with an evenly spaced distribution across the entire range of 8 million possible bits. The compression is also dependant on which bits are set, so this is a worse case. The more the bits are clumped together (within the same `byte`), the more it will be compressed.

So over the entire Stack Overflow data set of 32,000 Tags, the Bitmaps compress down to  an impressive **1.17GB**, compared to 149GB uncompressed!

## <a name="Results"></a>**Results**

But do queries against compressed Bitmaps actually perform faster than the naive queries using `HashSets` (see code above). Well yes they do and in some cases the difference is significant.

As you can see below, for `AND NOT` queries they are much faster, especially compared to the worse-case where the regular/naive code takes over 150 ms and the compressed Bitmap code takes ~5 ms (the x-axis is `# of excluded/skipped questions` and the y-axis is `time in milliseconds`).

For reference there are 194,384 questions tagged with `.net` and 528,490 tagged with `jquery`.

To ensure I'm being fair, I should point out that the compressed Bitmap queries are *slower* for `OR` queries, as shown below. But note the scale, they take ~5 ms compared to ~1-2 ms for the regular queries, so the compressed Bitmap queries are still fast! The nice things about the compressed Bitmap queries is that they take the same amount of time, regardless of how many questions we skip, whereas the regular queries get slower as `# of excluded/skipped questions` increases.

But there's still more things to implement, in future posts I hope to cover the following:

- Currently my implementation doesn't play nicely with the Garbage Collector and it does lots of allocations. I will attempt to replicate the "no-allocations" rule that Stack Overflow have after [their battle with the .NET GC](http://blog.marcgravell.com/2011/10/assault-by-gc.html)
