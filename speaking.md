<blockquote>
Performance is a fascinating topic in my opinion, and this was my favorite talk of them all.
</blockquote>

<b>I'm happy with that!</b>

Starting with the premise that "Performance is a Feature", this session will look at how to measure, what to measure and how get the best performance from your .NET code. We will look at real-world examples from the Roslyn code-base and StackOverflow.

Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/craigtptech" target="_blank">@craigtptech</a> for the image and also for his <a href="http://blog.craigtp.co.uk/post/DDD-East-Anglia-2014-Review" target="_blank">excellent write up</a>, I've included a few quotes below:

<blockquote>Matt starts by asking Why does performance matter? What do we need to know? and When do we need to optimize performance?</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Matt does suggest that we need to be careful and land somewhere in the middle of the spectrum between "optimizing everything all the time" (which can back us into a corner) versus "don't optimize anything" (the extreme end of the "performance optimization is the root of all evil" approach).

One of my slides was tweeted by an attendee and at last count had over <strong>500 re-tweets</strong>, it seems like a lot of people really like statistics and in particular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling" target="_blank">Hans Rosling</a>!!
